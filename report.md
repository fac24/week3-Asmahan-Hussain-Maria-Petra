# Project Report

## Introduction


## Project Scope


## Project Plan


## Requirement analysis
- We aim to write our code with accessibility in mind to ensure as many users as possible can benefit from our app. This includes using semantic HTML, referring to lighthouse reports to flag any accessibility issues and carefully considering the overall visual design of the app


## Project learnings
- Our team worked effectively as communication was always clear and timely. We all took time to support each other on the different issues we faced and collaborated on resolving them when necessary. 
- We pair-programmed and divided the workload fairly, taking into consideration who would want to work on a specific issue.
- If we worked on this project again, additional time would have been helpful as we would have benefitted from extra time to address issues regarding functionality.
    
    
## Research and findings
- We found out that there were some issues with the delete functionality- this is largely due to time constraints. 


## Project outcomes


## Recommendations and conclusions
- In the future, we would prioritise a page that features one users' data so that users can see only the posts they've submitted. 
- The project was certainly a success as we learned a lot and collaborated well to build the application in the given time.
